# Cursor Rules for AI Video Marketing Platform

## üéØ General Development Principles

### Code Quality & Structure
- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality
- Never replace code with placeholders like `// ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue
- Add console logs when needed to gather more information
- Maintain consistent code style using ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use TypeScript for all new code with proper type definitions

### Architecture Adherence
- Follow the established layered architecture: Client ‚Üí Frontend ‚Üí API ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Data layers
- Implement proper separation of concerns between layers
- Use the established provider abstraction pattern for external services
- Maintain the MCP integration structure as defined in the project

## üåê Multilingual & Internationalization

### RTL Language Support
- Always test UI changes with both LTR (English) and RTL (Hebrew/Arabic) languages
- Use logical CSS properties (margin-inline-start/end) instead of directional properties when applicable
- Implement proper text alignment and layout direction switching
- Ensure all icons and UI elements flip appropriately for RTL languages

### i18n Implementation
- Use i18next framework with Next.js integration
