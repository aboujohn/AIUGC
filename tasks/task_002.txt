# Task ID: 2
# Title: Configure MCP Integration Foundation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Setup Model Context Protocol (MCP) configuration for development workflow enhancement
# Details:
Create .cursor/mcp.json and ~/.cursor/mcp.json configurations. Setup Supabase MCP for database operations, GitHub MCP for repository management, and Puppeteer MCP for UI testing. Configure environment variables securely for MCP servers. Install required MCP packages: mcp-supabase-server, mcp-github-server, mcp-puppeteer-server.

# Test Strategy:
Verify MCP servers connect successfully, database queries work through Supabase MCP, GitHub operations function correctly, and Puppeteer can launch browser instances.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configuration File Creation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create and structure the main MCP configuration file with proper JSON schema and server definitions for all MCP integrations
### Details:
Set up the base MCP configuration file (mcp.json or similar) with proper structure for defining multiple MCP servers, including Supabase, GitHub, Puppeteer, F2C, Fetch, Ashra, and E2B. Define server endpoints, authentication methods, and connection parameters.

## 2. Environment Variable Security Setup [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Configure secure environment variable management for all MCP server authentication credentials and sensitive configuration data
### Details:
Set up .env files, environment variable validation, and secure credential storage for API keys, tokens, and connection strings. Implement proper variable naming conventions and security best practices for Supabase, GitHub, Puppeteer, F2C, Fetch, Ashra, and E2B credentials.

## 3. Supabase MCP Server Setup [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Configure Supabase MCP server with database connection, authentication, and API access
### Details:
Set up Supabase MCP server configuration including database URL, service role key, authentication settings, and table access permissions. Configure connection pooling and query optimization settings.

## 4. GitHub MCP Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Configure GitHub MCP server with repository access, authentication tokens, and API integration
### Details:
Set up GitHub MCP server with personal access tokens or GitHub App authentication, repository permissions, webhook configurations, and API rate limiting. Configure access to specific repositories and organizations.

## 5. Puppeteer and Additional MCP Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Configure Puppeteer MCP server and additional MCP servers (F2C, Fetch, Ashra, E2B) with proper authentication and settings
### Details:
Set up Puppeteer MCP server with browser automation settings, headless configuration, and security policies. Configure F2C, Fetch, Ashra, and E2B MCP servers with their respective API keys, endpoints, and authentication methods.

## 6. MCP Server Testing and Validation [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3, 2.4, 2.5
### Description: Test all MCP server connections, validate configurations, and ensure proper authentication and functionality
### Details:
Perform comprehensive testing of all MCP server connections, validate authentication flows, test API endpoints, verify environment variable loading, and ensure proper error handling. Create test scripts for ongoing validation and monitoring.
