# Task ID: 13
# Title: Build Video Generation Workflow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement end-to-end video generation process with progress tracking
# Details:
Create video generation queue system using Bull Queue with Redis, implement job processing with progress updates, error handling, and retry logic. Setup video storage in AWS S3 with CloudFront CDN. Implement quality preset system (720p, 1080p, 4K) with time/cost estimation. Add video thumbnail generation and metadata extraction.

# Test Strategy:
Test video generation completes successfully, progress tracking updates correctly, error handling works for failed generations, and video quality meets specifications.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Queue System Setup with Bull and Redis [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement Redis-backed queue system using Bull for video processing jobs with proper connection management and clustering support
### Details:
Set up Redis cluster, configure Bull queue with appropriate concurrency settings, implement job prioritization, and establish queue monitoring dashboard. Include connection pooling and failover mechanisms for high availability.

## 2. Job Processing Engine Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Create robust job processing system with worker management, resource allocation, and concurrent processing capabilities
### Details:
Implement worker processes with FFmpeg integration, resource monitoring, memory management, and CPU throttling. Include job lifecycle management and worker health checks with automatic scaling based on queue depth.

## 3. Progress Tracking and Real-time Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2
### Description: Develop comprehensive progress tracking system with WebSocket integration for real-time status updates
### Details:
Implement progress calculation based on video duration and processing stages, WebSocket server for live updates, progress persistence in Redis, and client-side progress visualization components with ETA calculations.

## 4. Error Handling and Logging System [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Build comprehensive error handling with detailed logging, categorization, and alerting mechanisms
### Details:
Implement error classification (transient vs permanent), structured logging with correlation IDs, error aggregation and reporting, dead letter queues for failed jobs, and integration with monitoring tools like Sentry or DataDog.

## 5. Retry Logic and Failure Recovery [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.4
### Description: Implement intelligent retry mechanisms with exponential backoff and failure recovery strategies
### Details:
Configure retry policies based on error types, implement exponential backoff with jitter, circuit breaker patterns, job resurrection from failed states, and automatic cleanup of stale jobs with configurable retry limits.

## 6. Storage Configuration and CDN Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up scalable storage solution with CDN integration for efficient video delivery and backup strategies
### Details:
Configure multi-tier storage (hot/warm/cold), implement CDN integration with CloudFront or similar, set up automated backup and archival policies, and establish storage optimization with compression and deduplication.

## 7. Quality Presets and Encoding Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2, 13.6
### Description: Develop flexible quality preset system with adaptive bitrate streaming and multi-format output support
### Details:
Create configurable quality presets (480p, 720p, 1080p, 4K), implement adaptive bitrate streaming with HLS/DASH, support multiple codecs (H.264, H.265, VP9), and include quality validation and optimization algorithms.

## 8. Thumbnail Generation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2, 13.6
### Description: Implement automated thumbnail generation with multiple extraction points and custom thumbnail support
### Details:
Generate thumbnails at multiple timestamps, implement scene detection for optimal thumbnail selection, support custom thumbnail uploads, create sprite sheets for video scrubbing, and optimize thumbnail storage and delivery.

## 9. Metadata Extraction and Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Build comprehensive metadata extraction system with video analysis and content indexing capabilities
### Details:
Extract technical metadata (duration, resolution, bitrate, codec), implement content analysis (scene detection, audio levels), support custom metadata fields, create searchable metadata index, and integrate with content management systems.

## 10. Performance Optimization and Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.3, 13.4, 13.5, 13.7, 13.8, 13.9
### Description: Implement comprehensive monitoring, performance optimization, and auto-scaling capabilities for the video processing pipeline
### Details:
Set up metrics collection (processing time, queue depth, error rates), implement auto-scaling based on load, optimize resource utilization, create performance dashboards, establish SLA monitoring, and implement predictive scaling algorithms.
