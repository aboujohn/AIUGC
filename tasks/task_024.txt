# Task ID: 24
# Title: Setup Production Deployment Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21, 22
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure production-ready deployment with auto-scaling and monitoring
# Details:
Setup AWS ECS or Kubernetes deployment, configure auto-scaling based on CPU/memory usage, implement blue-green deployment strategy. Setup production database with read replicas, configure backup and disaster recovery procedures. Implement environment-specific configurations and secrets management.

# Test Strategy:
Test deployment pipeline deploys successfully, auto-scaling responds to load changes, blue-green deployment works without downtime, and backup/recovery procedures function correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Container Orchestration Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up AWS ECS or Kubernetes cluster with proper networking, security groups, and service mesh configuration for container orchestration
### Details:
Configure ECS/EKS cluster, VPC networking, security groups, load balancers, service discovery, and container registry integration. Implement proper RBAC and network policies.

## 2. Auto-scaling Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Configure horizontal and vertical auto-scaling policies based on CPU, memory, and custom metrics with proper scaling thresholds
### Details:
Set up HPA/VPA for Kubernetes or ECS auto-scaling policies, CloudWatch metrics, scaling triggers, and resource limits. Configure cluster auto-scaling for nodes.

## 3. Blue-Green Deployment Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Implement blue-green deployment pipeline with automated traffic switching and rollback capabilities
### Details:
Set up deployment pipelines, traffic routing mechanisms, health checks, automated testing gates, and rollback procedures. Configure load balancer for traffic switching.

## 4. Production Database Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure production database with high availability, security, and performance optimization
### Details:
Set up RDS/Aurora with Multi-AZ deployment, encryption at rest and in transit, parameter groups, security groups, and monitoring. Configure connection pooling.

## 5. Read Replicas Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.4
### Description: Set up read replicas for database load distribution and improved read performance
### Details:
Configure read replicas across multiple AZs, implement read/write splitting in application, set up replica lag monitoring, and failover procedures.

## 6. Backup Procedures Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.4
### Description: Implement automated backup strategies for databases and application data with retention policies
### Details:
Set up automated database backups, point-in-time recovery, backup encryption, cross-region backup replication, and backup testing procedures.

## 7. Disaster Recovery Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.4, 24.5, 24.6
### Description: Implement comprehensive disaster recovery plan with multi-region failover capabilities
### Details:
Set up cross-region replication, disaster recovery runbooks, RTO/RPO targets, automated failover procedures, and regular DR testing protocols.

## 8. Environment Configuration Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Set up environment-specific configurations with proper separation and deployment automation
### Details:
Configure environment variables, config maps, environment-specific settings, deployment configurations, and environment promotion pipelines.

## 9. Secrets Management Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1, 24.8
### Description: Implement secure secrets management with encryption, rotation, and access control
### Details:
