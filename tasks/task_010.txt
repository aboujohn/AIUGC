# Task ID: 10
# Title: Design Video API Abstraction Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Create provider-agnostic interface for multiple video generation APIs
# Details:
Implement Adapter pattern for video providers (Runway, Pika, future VEO3), create unified interface for video generation requests, status checking, and result handling. Setup provider configuration management, fallback logic, and load balancing. Implement cost tracking per provider and quality preset standardization. Use Factory pattern for provider selection.

# Test Strategy:
Test provider switching works seamlessly, fallback logic activates correctly when primary provider fails, cost tracking is accurate, and quality presets produce consistent results across providers.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Unified Interface Design [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a common interface that all providers must adhere to, ensuring consistent method signatures and data structures across different AI service providers.
### Details:
Create abstract base classes and interfaces defining standard methods for text generation, image processing, and other AI operations. Include common parameters like model selection, temperature, max tokens, and response formatting. Design extensible interface that can accommodate future provider capabilities.

## 2. Adapter Pattern Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement adapter classes for each AI provider to translate between the unified interface and provider-specific APIs, handling differences in request/response formats.
### Details:
Create concrete adapter classes for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and other providers. Handle API-specific authentication, request formatting, response parsing, and error code translation. Implement provider-specific optimizations while maintaining interface compliance.

## 3. Provider Configuration Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop a flexible configuration system for managing multiple provider settings, credentials, rate limits, and feature capabilities.
### Details:
Create configuration schemas for provider credentials, endpoint URLs, rate limits, model mappings, and feature flags. Implement secure credential storage, environment-based configuration, and runtime configuration updates. Support provider-specific settings and global defaults.

## 4. Factory Pattern Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Implement factory classes to dynamically create and manage provider instances based on configuration and runtime requirements.
### Details:
Create provider factory that instantiates appropriate adapters based on configuration. Implement provider discovery, validation, and initialization. Support lazy loading, singleton patterns for expensive resources, and provider health checking.

## 5. Fallback Logic Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Develop intelligent fallback mechanisms to automatically switch between providers when primary services fail or are unavailable.
### Details:
Implement cascading fallback chains with configurable priority orders. Handle different failure scenarios (rate limits, service outages, authentication errors). Include circuit breaker patterns, exponential backoff, and provider health monitoring for intelligent failover decisions.

## 6. Load Balancing Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Implement load balancing algorithms to distribute requests across multiple providers based on performance, cost, and availability metrics.
### Details:
Develop round-robin, weighted, and performance-based load balancing strategies. Implement real-time provider performance monitoring, request queuing, and dynamic weight adjustment. Support sticky sessions for conversation continuity and provider affinity rules.

## 7. Cost Tracking and Quality Standardization [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.5, 10.6
### Description: Implement comprehensive cost tracking across providers and establish quality metrics for standardized performance evaluation.
### Details:
Create cost calculation engines for different pricing models (per-token, per-request, subscription). Implement quality metrics tracking (response time, accuracy, completion rates). Develop cost optimization algorithms and quality-based provider selection. Include detailed analytics and reporting capabilities.

## 8. Error Handling and Retry Strategies [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.5, 10.6, 10.7
### Description: Develop comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms with exponential backoff, jitter, and provider-specific error recovery strategies.
### Details:
Implement standardized error classification and handling across providers. Create retry strategies with configurable backoff algorithms, jitter, and maximum retry limits. Handle rate limiting, temporary failures, and permanent errors differently. Include detailed error logging and monitoring for debugging and optimization.
