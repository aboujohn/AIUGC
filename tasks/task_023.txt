# Title: Implement Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19, 20
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize platform performance for speed and scalability
# Details:
Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data, optimize database queries with proper indexing, setup CDN for static assets. Implement image optimization with Next.js Image component, lazy loading for video content, code splitting for reduced bundle sizes. Setup performance monitoring and optimization alerts.

# Test Strategy:
Measure page load times, verify caching improves performance, test image optimization reduces load times, and confirm code splitting reduces initial bundle size.
